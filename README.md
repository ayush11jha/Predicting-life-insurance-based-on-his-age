Predicting Life Insurance Purchase Based on Age

This project aims to predict whether a person would buy life insurance based on their age using a simple machine learning model.
Overview
The project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to a straightforward classification problem. A dataset containing two features, Age and Bought Insurance (0 for no, 1 for yes), is used to train a model to predict if a person will purchase life insurance based on their age.

Dataset
The dataset consists of two columns:
Age: The age of the individual.
Bought Insurance: A binary value indicating whether the individual purchased insurance (1) or not (0).
